      <h2>My bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        Coding is really fun. We spent 3 weeks on back end programming in Ruby, and are now onto front-end language with HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>A super nice batch crew</h2>
      <p>It is sixteen of us, and a very nice team.

      <h2>This is only the begining</h2>
